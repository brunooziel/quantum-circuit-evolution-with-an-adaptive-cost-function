# Quantum Circuit Evolution with Adaptive Cost Function

This repository contains the implementation of a novel approach to quantum circuit optimization using an adaptive cost function (ACF) framework. The project demonstrates the potential of Quantum Circuit Evolution (QCE) in solving binary optimization problems, particularly in comparison to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).

## Overview

The project introduces a framework that combines Quantum Circuit Evolution with an Adaptive Cost Function (QCE-ACF) to solve binary optimization problems. This approach offers several advantages:

- Classical optimizer-free methodology
- Dynamic cost function adaptation
- Improved convergence performance
- Shorter execution time compared to QAOA
- Robustness in noisy quantum environments

## Project Structure

- `_utility.py`: Utility functions and helper methods
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the main implementation and examples
- `instances_benchmark/`: Directory containing benchmark instances for testing
